This is a sample Android application which uses the google-api-java-client library to demonstrate uploading a file to Google Docs.

This app will

*  Perform OAuth2 authorization against Google Docs
*  Create a folder (known as a collection) in Google Docs
*  Upload a file to Google Docs (inside that folder)
*  Update a file on Google Docs

I'm creating this sample app because there is very little in the way of examples on uploading to Google Docs and using the google-api-java-client library.
