This is a sample Android application which uses the [google-api-java-client](http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/) library.

This app will

*  Perform OAuth2 authorization against Google Docs
*  Upload a file to Google Docs (inside a folder)
*  Update a file on Google Docs

I'm creating this sample app because there is very little in the way of examples on uploading to Google Docs and using the google-api-java-client library.
